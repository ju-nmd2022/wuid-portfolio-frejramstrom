    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
      Congratulations! Somehow, you've found this website! You probably cry your
      eyes out when seeing the design of this website, but there is a solid
      reason for it!
      <br />
      <br />
      My name is Frej, and this is my first year of studying New Media Design in
      Jönköping!
      <br />
      <br />
      I want to learn a lot more in the future about designing websites, perhaps
      more flashy ones, with grids and floating text?
